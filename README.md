# Final Dashboard: Preterm Birth in African American Women

## Rationale

The rates of early term and preterm birth are much higher in African
American women than women of any other race or ethnicity. It is
important to elucidate factors that may impact preterm and early term
birth in this sensitive population to improve birth outcomes more
effectively.

## Data

The data used in this dashboard has been simulated from the Atlanta
African American Maternal Child cohort (2014-2019); the original dataset
was not used for confidentiality purposes. Data was simulated using mean
and standard deviation for age, and relative proportions for birth
outcome, BMI category, and educational attainment. The original cohort
included pregnant African American women who were recruited from Grady
Hospital and Emory University Hospital Midtown during their first
clinical visit from 2014-2019. The simulated data used a sample size of
N = 600 participants.

## Research Questions

1.  How does maternal age vary based on whether they experienced full
    term, early term, or preterm birth? How do these distributions vary
    by maternal BMI category?
2.  How does the percentage of full term, early term, and preterm birth
    vary based on maternal educational level?
